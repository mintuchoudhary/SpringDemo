/*Spring AOP (Aspect-oriented programming) framework is used to modularize cross-cutting concerns in aspects. Put it simple, it's' just an interceptor to intercept some processes,
 * for example, when a method is execute, Spring AOP can hijack the executing method, and add extra functionality before or after the method execution.

In Spring AOP, 4 type of advices are supported :

Before advice : Run before the method execution
After returning advice : Run after the method returns a result
After throwing advice : Run after the method throws an exception
Around advice : Run around the method execution, combine all three advices above.
