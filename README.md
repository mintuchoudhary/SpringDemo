Programmatic transactions give precise control on the boundaries of the transaction.
Declarative transactions 
  - are defined using annotations
  - less intrusive and are defined in Configuration file
  - based on AOP concepts. This gives advantage of keeping the cross cutting concerns like transactions out of our DAO layer code.
